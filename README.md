## Design Choices

### Typography
The fonts used are Orbitron with a fallback of verdana.
   *  The Orbitron font gives the game both an old sci-fi spacecraft style and a retro arcade game style.
   
### Colour scheme
   * The colour scheme used is black (#000000) for the background and greenyellow (#ADFF2F) for text. A contrasting warm orange and brown graphic is used for the background to the game page.
   * The black background of the landing page gives a premium feel to the site. It helps immediatley convey the theme of the game being set in space to the user. 
   * Black is also used to frame the game on the game page and mimics an old Arcade game screen adding to the users experience. 
   * The greenyellow colour used for the text helps create the sci-fi spaceship retro arcade game style. The colour stands out on the black background an is clearly readible to the user throughout the site.
   * The warm orange and brown graphic used as the background to the game area also contrasts with the black frame and gives a warm welcoming feeling to the user.
